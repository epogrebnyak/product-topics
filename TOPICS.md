Workflow
========

Linear product workflow
-----------------------

1. Discovery (domain, product idea, user case, business case, technical feasibilty)
2. Requirements and specification (features, backlog, prioritisation, requirements to specification)
3. Build (architecture, sprints, testing)
4. Operate (monitoring)
5. Adjustments (what to do next, strategy, roadmap, metrics, business sense)

There is a similar workflow described in Chapter 6 of Marty Cagan "Inpsire" book, 
called "The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts" 
(there is also a [49 min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dccd8lihpQ)).

I believe the above workflow is still useful to learn as a starting reference, 
as many parts of it are repeated in advanced workflows, 
albeit under different founding principles.

Advanced product workflow
-------------------------
 
The linear product flow above is just a hidden waterfall - let's have a good specification,
build it, ship and repeat as needed.

The promised land of product development is continious discovery and delivery
leading to crystallisation of successful products. 

Companies and teams vary by degree of sophistication, planning process and rhetoric they attach 
to product development.
