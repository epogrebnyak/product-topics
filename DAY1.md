I'm creating a course on product management for economics/finance students 
interested in working in tech.

We have some material about what product is and PM compentence model, 
but would like to bring in some real life experiences through exercises
in:

- user experience and user analytics
- validating product ideas, prototyping
- writing a product specification (a product requirements document, PRD or other form)
- making user interfaces with desingers 
- discussing engineering with tech lead or developers
- keeping the backlog
- scheduling work, team meetings
- keeping notes and writing
- coming up with product success metrics, OKR/KPI 
- estimating and increasing product business value
- thingink of product portfolio or company strategy
- other points of PM work

This list is to be discussed, provided as an example. 

Out best case is that we move from competences to actually developing 
these comptences witha help of product manager who can describe 
actual work tasks and ways to assess if a student did something 
on right or wrong direction. 

Ideally, there should be some prescriptive excercises on "happy paths"
(good situations) and "sad paths" (bad situations when things go wrong).
