Excercises
==========

We creating a course on product management for economics/finance students 
interested in working in tech.

Ideally:

1. small, modular problems, not big complex cases (bigger cases [are here](CASES.md))
2. a problem that relates to some part of product workflow (eg. product discovery) or to some PM competence (eg problem-solving)
3. we should how to way evaluate and assess the student solution or answer to a problem
4. state learning outcome: "after this excercise a student can \< do something - prioritise, choose bewteen, make a decision, etc \>, not "will know about"  

... but sometime you have just a good idea about an excercise and 
in doubt about how to evaluate a student or learning outcome - so let us 
work on that idea too.

Among other things, the excercises can show "happy paths" (good situations) 
and "sad paths" (bad situations when things go wrong).

Workflow-related:

- product discovery, validating product ideas
- user experience and user analytics
- requirements, specification, product requirements document (PRD)
- keeping the backlog, prioritisation 
- prototyping, MVP
- build
- deploy and monitor 
- learn and reiterate

Working with:

- designers 
- engineering team and tech leads

Skill-related:

- scheduling work, team meetings
- keeping notes and writing
- coming up with product success metrics
- project metircs - OKR/KPI 
- estimating and increasing product business value
- thinking of product portfolio or company strategy
- other points of PM work
