Excercises
==========

We creating a course on product management for economics/finance students 
interested in working in tech.

We need excercises at various topics of product management. 

Ideally, these excercises are:

1. small and modular
2. relate to some part of product workflow (eg. product discovery) or to some PM competence (eg problem-solving)
3. we know how to evaluate student solution or answer
4. we can think of a learning outcome: "after this excercise a student can \< do something - prioritise, choose bewteen, make a decision, etc \>, not "will know about"  

Sometimes you have just a good idea about an excercise and 
in doubt about how to evaluate a student or learning outcome - so let us 
work on that idea too.

Among other things, the excercises can show "happy paths" (good situations) 
and "sad paths" (bad situations when things go wrong). One might argue that
"sad paths" teach you more than "happy paths". 

Topics for excercises are below.

Workflow-related:

- product discovery, validating product ideas
- user experience and user analytics
- requirements, specification, product requirements document (PRD)
- keeping the backlog, prioritisation 
- prototyping, MVP
- build
- deploy and monitor 
- learn and reiterate

Higher-level:

- coming up with product success metrics
- project metircs - OKR/KPI 
- estimating and increasing product business value
- product portfolio 
- strategy

Working with:

- designers 
- engineering team

Skill-related:

- scheduling work, team meetings
- keeping notes and writing
- issues and issue tracker
- other points of PM work
