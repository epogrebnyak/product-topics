Excercises
==========

We creating a course on product management for economics/finance students 
interested in working in tech.

This section contians excercises for the students to 

Tentative requirements:

- small, modular problems, not big complex cases (separate section of this course manual for [big cases](CASES.md))
- a problem should relate to some part of product workflow (eg. product discovery) or to some PM competence (eg problem-solving)
- we state a way evaluate and assess the student solution
- learning outcome: after this excercise a student can <do something - prioritise, choose bewteen, make a decision, etc>, not "will know about"  

In ideal situation there requirements should be met, but sometime you have just a good idea 
about an excercise and in doubt about how to evaluate a student or learbing outcome - so let us 
work on that idea too.

For new products and startups:

- product discovery, validating product ideas
- specification coming up with feature list, backlog
- MVP
- build 
- deploy and monitor 
- learn and reiterate

For larger companies and mature products:

- user experience and user analytics
- prototyping
- writing a specification (product requirements document, PRD or some other form)
- working with making user interfaces with 
- discussing engineering with tech lead or developers
- keeping the backlog

General 
- scheduling work, team meetings
- keeping notes and writing
- coming up with product success metrics, OKR/KPI 
- estimating and increasing product business value
- thingink of product portfolio or company strategy
- other points of PM work

This list is to be discussed, provided as an example. 

Out best case is that we move from competences to actually developing 
these comptences witha help of product manager who can describe 
actual work tasks and ways to assess if a student did something 
on right or wrong direction. 

Ideally, there should be some prescriptive excercises on "happy paths"
(good situations) and "sad paths" (bad situations when things go wrong).
