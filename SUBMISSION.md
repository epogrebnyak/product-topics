[Problem]
Suppose you are PM of a squad whose product is a lead generator (possible customers) for personal loans.

Reference: https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/loan.php

Your product's revenue is based on the commission paid by advertisers located at the “Current Personal Loan Rates” area. Every time a user buys a loan that came from your product (its possible to track this), you generate revenue for your company based on your product.

Therefore, it makes sense for your company to increase the volume of users who purchase loans from their trading partners.

Data (students can create a copy to make the exercises): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Km3nvGalFqmwsqDwYfy_jvtFL0g1Yvzn28nDih4Feso/edit?usp=sharing
Details:
- The commission is the same for any sale
- The spreadsheet has three tabs:
- - Organic traffic: comes from organic searches on search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing
- - Recommendation: is when the user comes from a recommendation from a friend who sent the link to him (this is tracked via utm parameters)
- - Comparison: Organic and Recommendation data together

[Questions] 
1. Based on the data, which traffic source is most relevant to the business today?
2. With the data available, create a metric to understand the potential business outcome for both types of traffic. Which one is the most qualified traffic (has the greatest power to generate sales per user volume)?
3. To increase organic traffic it is necessary to do SEO optimizations (search engine optimization), which are well known by digital marketing experts, therefore, we will focus on recommendation traffic. In the product optimization process, solution hypotheses are tested, which are tentative to solve the “problem”. What hypotheses would you test to increase the volume of referral traffic (ideally more than one hypotheses)? (Hint: research how famous start-ups do to engage users to recommend their products to their friends)
4. Create a metric to measure the form's success rate. What hypotheses would you test to improve your success rate (ideally more than one)? (Suggestion: simulate the use of the product from the point of view of different types of users)
5. Suppose you decided to optimize recommendation traffic and chose two hypotheses to test:
- Create buttons to share the simulator on social networks (facebook, twitter, whatsapp, etc);
- Allow clients (sales convertion) to post that they used the simulator link on social media;
Before prototyping and implementing it is important to validate that the hypotheses make sense, that is, to understand the associated risks. The risks are usually 3, business risk (will solve the problem / generate more sales), usability (will the user use?) and technology (is it possible to create this solution in a timely manner?
As we believe that the increase in recommendations generates sales results, let's assume that the business risk is resolved. So let's focus on usability risk. An opportunity to address these risks is to talk to users to understand how they address this issue (loans) and ask questions that help reduce the risk of creating something they would not use (Hint: be careful not to ask something in a way that will bias the user to answer what you would like them to answer, not the truth).
Therefore, formulate some questions that you would ask potential users of this simulator to reduce the risk of constructing these two hypotheses.

[Answers]
1. It is currently Organic, as the sales volume is higher.
2. The metric is conversion (sales/page view), as we have the business end result connected to raw traffic. The most qualified traffic is recommendation, as it has a ~7% conversion, while organic is ~0.7%
3. Since referral traffic is higher converting, and the current product has no incentives for a user to refer friends, it makes sense to test this traffic model further. Some ideas for more engaging users to recommend:
- Create buttons to share the simulator on social networks (facebook, twitter, whatsapp, etc);
- Allow borrowers to post that they used the simulator link on social media;
- Provide rewards to whoever recommends to users who purchase the product, such as discounted loan fees, gift cards or simply a portion of the money, as if it were a commission.
4. The metric is (Success / Page views) as it measures the rate of users arriving at the product and using the simulator. Some interesting hypotheses:
- Improve simulator design, giving more focus on simulator information and less focus on out-of-context items, such as items on the left side of the page;
- Optimized design for the mobile experience;
- Better explain the “technical” terms, so that users who know little or nothing about loans feel confident and continue with the selection process.
5. The possibilities are many, but it would be interesting to go through these questions:
- Do you often use social media? Which?
- - What types of content do you consume?
- - What types of content do you usually share?
- -  Do you share details of your daily life?
- What factors tend to make you more confident when you are going to purchase a product or service for the first time?
- When you use a product or service that exceeds your expectations, do you take any special action on behalf of the company that made the product or service?
- Would you feel comfortable in publicizing on social networks that you intend to acquire or that you have acquired a loan? (I would leave it last, as it will skew, although it seems to be very assertive)
