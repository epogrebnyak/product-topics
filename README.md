# Topics in product management

- This document is a draft for lecture or seminar series on Product Management.
- The intended audience is economics/finance students with interest in tech.
- There is a heavy borrowing from John Cutler, with references (I'm a fan).

## What is product?

1. Life before products 

  - Niel McElroy (1931) and birth of brand-centered FMCG
  - Microsoft Excel before program managers

  Excercise:

  - What changed? What were the drivers and conditions for products to emerge?
  - What are product expectiations from the company and user perspective?

2. What is a product? (short)

  - [John Culter vimeo video (2017)](https://vimeo.com/248503272)

3. How is product created? What is a typical product pipeline?

  - Is there a simple reference workflow for product development?

```

  Idea -> Usecase -> Specification and Design -> Implementation -> Release -> Success

```

  - Is this workflow above good (spoiler: no)?
  - Can this workflow be modified?
 
## PM role and skills

4. What are the job requirements for product managers?

   Excercise: use job ads (Linkedin, HH.ru) to list:

   - key job responsibilities for PM 
   - PM candidate requirements

   Extra questions:

   - What are core resposibilities and requirements and what the extras? 
   - How do FAANG PM jobs differ from smaller companies, based on job ads?
   - Are non-IT products different, based on job ads?

5. Why PM is really a hard job?

6. What does PM do? (short)

7. What are PM competences and skills?

  - Competence model 1: [@shreyas](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1282690821335027713?s=20)
  - [12 things by John Culter](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/12-core-competencies-for-product-managers-8d5744f91bd)

  In Russian:

  - Competence model 2 (FRII)
  - Competence model 3 (Russian official teaching standards)

  Excercise: link competences to project pipeline

  Excercise: use a selected competence model to prioritise 
             what is most useful for a product management job, 
             based on your experience.
