#### 1. What is a product and product history [DONE]

<details>
<summary>Details and takeaways</summary>

Takeaways:

   - product is customer pain and software engineering does not like this defintion  
</details>
    
#### 2. Job market - what is product manager (PM) hired for

<details>
<summary>Details and takeaways</summary>

   - job descriptions  
   - PM competences and skills
   - PM performance expectations

Takeaways:
   
   - PM has to do a lot, the pressure comes from organisation's target innovate at shorter cycles
   - PM is not a project manager

</details>
    

#### 3. Simplified product workflow

 - Scoping (define what a new product will be or how to refine existing product)
 - Delivery (make MVP or add new functionality)
 - Evaluation (see it works work, what we learned, decide what to do next)

<details>
<summary>Takeaways</summary>

- product scoping may miss a product, none of frameworks guarantees a product
- agile is just an iterative delivery method
- evaluation steers next steps, better if designed at scoping
- teams may have different configuation to work on a product

</details>

    
#### 4. Advanced product workflow 

<details>
<summary>Details and takeaways</summary>

 - Why linear product workflow may fail ("build trap" / "death cylce") 
 - Advanced workflow - how to make product that really works?

Takeaways:

- market matters (if customers do not go away, no need for product at all)
- product alone does not make $1bn company, some $1bn companies are build around mediocre products
- many companies could not forecast what their product would be at start
- some companies failed  
- companies and teams often mimic product development
 
</details>
    
#### 5. Product teams in organisation

## 1. What is product?

### 1.1 Life before products 

  - Niel McElroy (1931) and birth of brand-centered FMCG
  - Microsoft Excel before program managers

  Excercise:

  - What changed? What were the drivers and conditions for products to emerge?
  - What are product expectiations from the company perspective?
  - What are product expectiations from the perspective?

  Reading:

  - [Martin Eriksson (2015). The History and Evolution of Product Management](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/history-evolution-product-management/)
  - [Ellen Chisa (2014). Evolution of the Product Manager.](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2683579)

### 1.2. Product universe

  Excercise: provide examples of products, including:
  
  - FMCG
  - physical products
  - mixed physical-digital products (Uber, AirBnB)
  - failed products
  - internal products
  - unexpected productisation
  - products within big companies
  - company=product
  - open source products
  - governement digital services and products
 
### 1.3. What is a product? (short video)

  - [John Culter vimeo video (2017)](https://vimeo.com/248503272)

## 2. Product manager (PM) role and skills

### 2.1. What are the job requirements for product managers?

Excercise: use job ads (Linkedin, HH.ru) to list:

- key job responsibilities for PM 
- PM candidate requirements

Extra questions:

- What are core resposibilities and requirements and what the extras? 
- How do FAANG PM jobs differ from smaller companies, based on job ads?
- Are non-IT products different, based on job ads? 

### 2.2. Why PM is really a hard job?

   - [John Cutler. 15 things you should know about product managers](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/15-things-you-should-know-about-product-managers-f488513d246)

### 2.3. What does PM do? (short)

  - [@shreyas definition](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1303150374124048386)

  > "Define the product & coordinate actions across the org to enable its success."

### 2.4. What are PM competences and skills?

See [Topics - Competences](TOPIC.md#Competences)

Excercises: 

- prioritize core and additional competences for a PM
- link competences to product workflow
- use a selected competence model to prioritise what is more useful for a product management job, based on your experience or relevant to you personally.

### 2.5. How to develop the PM skills?

## 3. Simple view of product workflow [WIP]

```
  Fantasy workflow:
  
  Idea -> [Something in between] -> Release -> Product Success
```

Companies would have used fantasy workflow above if it worked. It does not work on a systematic basis.

Depending on competitive pressures and organisational culture companies choose to:

- add more stages to workflow
- standardize some parts of workflow (scrum, safe, less, etc)
- add more names to parts of workflow 
- mimic management does a good job of managing the workflow 
- go back and forth in the workflow, iterate in this workflow 
- delegate responsibility to PM
- isolate parts of workflow
- allow teams to decide
- set overall objectives, separate problems and solutions
- (anything else?)

In this course we learn a three-stage and quite linear workflow 
before learning more advanced workflows.

The reference product workflow is:

 - Scoping (define what a new product will be or how to refine existing product)
 - Delivery (make MVP or add new functionality)
 - Evaluation (see it works work, what we learned, decide what to do next)
