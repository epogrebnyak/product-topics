# Topics in product management

- This document is a draft for lecture or seminar series on Product Management.
- The intended audience is economics/finance students with interest in tech.
- There is a heavy borrowing from John Cutler, with references (I'm a fan).

[Presenation draft](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P10i8X-A19H9RBKdSx4iaS_wfm2R1X9TDcHB6Tz5GFU/edit#slide=id.ged30c9f7cb_0_57)

## 1. What is product?

### 1.1 Life before products 

  - Niel McElroy (1931) and birth of brand-centered FMCG
  - Microsoft Excel before program managers

  Excercise:

  - What changed? What were the drivers and conditions for products to emerge?
  - What are product expectiations from the company and user perspective?

### 1.2. What is a product? (short video)

  - [John Culter vimeo video (2017)](https://vimeo.com/248503272)

### 1.3. How is product created? What is a typical product pipeline?

```

  Idea -> Usecase -> Features -> Implementation -> Release -> Success
         (-------- PRD --------)     

```
  - Is there a simple reference workflow for product development?
  - Is this workflow above good (spoiler: no)?
  - Can this workflow be modified?
 
## 2. Product manager (PM) role and skills

### 2.1. What are the job requirements for product managers?

  Excercise: use job ads (Linkedin, HH.ru) to list:

    - key job responsibilities for PM 
    - PM candidate requirements

  Extra questions:

    - What are core resposibilities and requirements and what the extras? 
    - How do FAANG PM jobs differ from smaller companies, based on job ads?
    - Are non-IT products different, based on job ads? 

### 2.2. Why PM is really a hard job?

  Excercise: link competences to project pipeline

  Excercise: use a selected competence model to prioritise 
             what is most useful for a product management job, 
             based on your experience.

Criticism
---------

- Should we give exact frameworks to work on product?
- Should we work on some product in class?

Notes
-----

- `Product -> Work Pipeline -> PM -> Teams -> ...`
- `User - Business - Technology`
- `UX - Development - Business`
- Beyond the obvious (eg product strategy)
- What can a class guest contribute?
