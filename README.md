### 1.3. What is a product? (short video)

  - [John Culter vimeo video (2017)](https://vimeo.com/248503272)

### 1.4. How is product created? What is a typical product pipeline?

  - Is there a simple reference workflow for product development (see comments about [Workflow](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/product-topics/blob/main/TOPICS.md#workflow))?
 
```
  Idea -> [Something in between] -> Release -> Product Success
```

  - Is a linear workflow good? Is anything missing?
  - What can be modified? Why does this need to be modified?
