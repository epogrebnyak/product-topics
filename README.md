# Topics in product management

(C) 2021, Evgeniy Pogrebnyak

About:

- This document is a draft for lecture or seminar series on Product Management.
- A lot of inspiration for the course ideas comes from reading John Cutler on Twitter, I cite him a lot with references.

Audience: 

- economics/finance graduate students with interest in tech
- junior people in tech with a bit of imposter syndrome

Current work:

  - refining the lecture series outline (this file)
  - adding practical excercises, cases and in-class simulations from real PM's (see [DAY1.md](DAY1.md)) 


- [Presenation draft 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P10i8X-A19H9RBKdSx4iaS_wfm2R1X9TDcHB6Tz5GFU/edit#slide=id.ged30c9f7cb_0_57)
- ..,

## 1. What is product?

### 1.1 Life before products 

  - Niel McElroy (1931) and birth of brand-centered FMCG
  - Microsoft Excel before program managers

  Excercise:

  - What changed? What were the drivers and conditions for products to emerge?
  - What are product expectiations from the company and user perspective?

### 1.2. Product universe

### 1.3. What is a product? (short video)

  - [John Culter vimeo video (2017)](https://vimeo.com/248503272)

### 1.4. How is product created? What is a typical product pipeline?

  - Is there a simple reference workflow for product development (see comments about [Workflow](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/product-topics/blob/main/TOPICS.md#workflow))?
 
```
  Idea -> [Something in between] -> Release -> Product Success
```

  - Is a linear workflow good? Is anything missing?
  - What can be modified? Why does this need to be modified?

## 2. Product manager (PM) role and skills

### 2.1. What are the job requirements for product managers?

  Excercise: use job ads (Linkedin, HH.ru) to list:

    - key job responsibilities for PM 
    - PM candidate requirements

  Extra questions:

    - What are core resposibilities and requirements and what the extras? 
    - How do FAANG PM jobs differ from smaller companies, based on job ads?
    - Are non-IT products different, based on job ads?

  Excercise: link competences to project pipeline

  Excercise: use a selected competence model to prioritise 
             what is most useful for a product management job, 
             based on your experience.
