# Topics in product management

- This document is a draft for lecture or seminar series on Product Management.
- The intended audience is economics/finance students with interest in tech.
- There is a heavy borrowing from John Cutler, with references (I'm a fan).

[Presenation draft]()

## 1. What is product?

### 1.1 Life before products 

  - Niel McElroy (1931) and birth of brand-centered FMCG
  - Microsoft Excel before program managers

  Excercise:

  - What changed? What were the drivers and conditions for products to emerge?
  - What are product expectiations from the company and user perspective?

### 1.2. What is a product? (short video)

  - [John Culter vimeo video (2017)](https://vimeo.com/248503272)

### 1.3. How is product created? What is a typical product pipeline?

```

  Idea -> Usecase -> Features -> Implementation -> Release -> Success

```
  - Is there a simple reference workflow for product development?
  - Is this workflow above good (spoiler: no)?
  - Can this workflow be modified?
 
## 2. Product manager (PM) role and skills

### 2.1. What are the job requirements for product managers?

  Excercise: use job ads (Linkedin, HH.ru) to list:

    - key job responsibilities for PM 
    - PM candidate requirements

  Extra questions:

    - What are core resposibilities and requirements and what the extras? 
    - How do FAANG PM jobs differ from smaller companies, based on job ads?
    - Are non-IT products different, based on job ads? 

### 2.2. Why PM is really a hard job?

   - [John Cutler. 15 things you should know about product managers](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/15-things-you-should-know-about-product-managers-f488513d246)

### 2.3. What does PM do? (short)

### 2.4. What are PM competences and skills?

  - Competence model 1: [@shreyas](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1282690821335027713?s=20)
  - [12 core competences by John Culter](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/12-core-competencies-for-product-managers-8d5744f91bd)
  - [GitLab PM competences](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-manager-role/product-CDF-competencies/)

  In Russian:

  - Competence model 2 (FRII)
  - Competence model 3 (Russian official teaching standards)

  Excercise: link competences to project pipeline

  Excercise: use a selected competence model to prioritise 
             what is most useful for a product management job, 
             based on your experience.

### 2.5. How to develop the PM skills?

Books

Criticism
---------

- Should we give exact frameworks to work on product?
- Should we work on some product in class?

Notes
-----

- `Product -> Work Pipeline -> PM -> Teams -> Cases`
- `User - Business - Technology`
- Beyond the obvious (eg product strategy)
- Topics and ideas that do not fit
- What can a class guest contribute?
